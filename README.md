== Week 2 of my 12 in 12 Challenge

My goal with this challenge is to teach myself Ruby on Rails by building a new web app (using rails) each week for 12 weeks.

This week I built a simple blog, where I can create posts (as well as edit and delete them), visitors can comment on posts, and I can log in out out.
